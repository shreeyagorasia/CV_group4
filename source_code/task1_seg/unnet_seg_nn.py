"""a) UNet-based end-to-end segmentation neural network: UNet is a popular archi-
tecture for image segmentation. Its encoder-decoder structure, with skip connections
between the encoder and decoder, helps preserve spatial information lost during down-
sampling and improves segmentation accuracy. Design your own UNet, and train it on
the dataset. The input to the UNet model should be the image, and the output will be
the image segmentation mask.
